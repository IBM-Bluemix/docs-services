# Creating content for the Bluemix doc app in the docs-services repository

Welcome to the [docs-services repository](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/docs-services/tree/staging) where you will create documentation for your service to be added to the Bluemix doc app.  

# Required elements

Your folder must contain at least the following two files:
* A [Getting Started tutorial](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/docs-services/blob/staging/getting_started_template/index.md) that is always named [index.md]
* A [toc file](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/docs-services/blob/staging/toc) for your navigation [toc]

**Important:** These files are required. You can link to any of your existing documentation by using the related links in the toc file and you can add additional files, as needed.

These files are sourced in Markdown, a lightweight markup language, and managed in GitHub.  

The Bluemix build creates HTML 5 output from this GitHub location for all 3rd party services.

## Using the getting started template (Required)
The getting started template (and the guideline comments it contains) provide a consistent look and feel to the documentation for all of the service across the Bluemix platform. The documentation provided for a service should enable your potential users to quickly determine that they want your service and then to quickly get up and running with it. It also serves as a learning tool for users to understand concepts about the service and the platform, including using the CLI and setting up an environment. Guide your users in answering the "I created my offering instance, now what?" question.

### Using the Copyright and Last Updated header (Required)
Both the span of years your content has been published across, and the last date that you updated your content is included at the top of the getting started template.  It must appear in your file in exactly the format as it is in the getting started template, as shown in the following example:

```
---

copyright:

  years: 2017

lastupdated: "2017-09-18"

---
```

The copyright and lastupdated information must occur at the top of the MD file, before attributes are listed.  
  * It must be --- surrounded by 3 dashes ---
  * The value `years` can contain just one year or two years separated by a comma, for example, `years: 2016, 2017`. If the topic was created in the current year, provide just one year for the years variable. If you have updated the topic over a span of more than the current year, provide the first year and the last (current) year, separated by a comma. Don't include the intervening years. For example, for a topic created in 2016 and updated until 2017, then list the years:  `2016, 2017`
  * The value `lastupdated` must be followed by a machine date in quotes in the following format: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  * Ensure that each time you update your Markdown topic, you also update the `lastupdated` date.
  
### Adding a unique ID (Required)
After the H1 (`# Getting started with`) heading, there is a `{: #gettingstarted}` ID tag that you need to edit to make it unique to your service.  If you are onboarding a service named, "All but the kitchen sink" for example, then your unique ID could be:

`{: #gettingstarted_allbutkitchensink}`

### Adding a short description (Required)
The short description should be 1-3 sentences that provide a very high level summary of your service. Clearly state the user's learning goal in the short description. Let the user know what he or she will get out of the tutorial. 

On the line immediately following your short description, ensure that you have preserved the following code in the getting started template so that the description displays properly:

`{:shortdesc}`

### Adding getting started steps (Required)
The getting started steps should include a brief introduction, which could be just a lead in sentence with a colon, for example:

`Use the following steps to install and set up the application:`

The getting started steps should follow and provide information about how to integrate the service into the app or use the service outside of Bluemix. Don't include steps to add the service from the catalog; always assume that your user is starting at the service dashboard.

**Tips**
 * With task-based, technical information, reduce the conversational style in favor of succinct and direct instructions.
 * Include the basic, most-common-use scenario steps to use the service or integrate it into the app. (Document edge cases in blogs as examples. If they become more common, consider moving them into the doc flow as child task flows.)
 * Include task-oriented and descriptive steps with code examples that can be copied. (The getting started template provides the quick and easy coding to make code snippets easily copied.)
 * For next steps, focus on the single thing the user needs to do next. Think "guided journey." 

If you have additional tasks to use your service (after the getting started topic), you can create additional task topics (files). See **Creating additional topics** for more information.

## Creating a table of contents (TOC) for your service catalog entry (Required)

To begin, you need to create a TOC map file in GitHub. This file must be in the root directory of your service. See the sample TOC in this (docs-services) folder.  You can copy it into the root directory of your service and edit it from there.

**Important note**:  The `toc` file has no extension; it is just named `toc`. When you create it in the root directory, do not add a file type.

The following toc file template is provided in the [base docs-services folder](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/docs-services/blob/staging/toc):

```
{:navgroup: .navgroup}
{:topicgroup: .topicgroup}

{: .toc subcollection="<FolderName>" audience="service" href="/docs/services/<FolderName>/index.html"}
<Name of service>

    {: .navgroup id="learn"}
    index.md

    {: .topicgroup}
    Related links
        [Link text](URL)
        [Link text](URL)
    {: .navgroup-end}

    {: .navgroup id="reference"}
    Reference
    [API Documentation](URL)
    {: .navgroup-end}
```

After you copy the entire toc file contents:
1. Do not alter the top two (navgroup and topicgroup) lines in the toc template.
2. Replace both of the `<FolderName>` placeholders with your folder name, in both locations.  
3. Replace `<Name of service>` with your service name.
4. And add any related links in the `[Link text](URL)` fields.  The `[Link text]` you provide is what is displayed in the left navigation panel and the `(URL)` is the external (`http` or `https`) link to your content when your user clicks the link text.  
5. If you only provide a single link, to your base documentation, for example, remove the second line of link text.  
6. Add your API documentation URL. You can change the link title `[API Documentation]` if you wish.
7. We recommend that you provide sample apps for your customers to use. Include links under the Reference section of your toc file that point to these sample apps. At a minimum, provide your sample apps in Node and Java.
8. If you want to add more files to your content, nesting additional files after the `index.md` file is as simple as indenting 4 spaces on the line beneath `index.md` and listing the additional `<file>.md` files that you add to your folder. You can nest multiple levels of files.

Notice that the `(URL)` values in the toc file are external links. You can add as many external links as you want. For example if I wanted to add a TOC entry for an API in API explorer, I could add: `[REST API](https://sample-console.{DomainName}/apidocs)` to my toc map file under the Reference section of the toc.

**Tip**: Keep in mind that the search results are generated from your TOC. (A search is generated from the TOC JSON file.) One of the ways you can improve SEO is to ensure that your TOC contains the critical topics you want your customers to find.

After you have your toc file created in GitHub, the Bluemix doc build picks this file up and generates your table of contents.

# Optional elements
In addition to the required elements, there are additional elements you can add, like other files with more information. Any supplemental information you choose to add should be task-based and it should support the productive use of the service. 

## Creating additional topics (optional)
If you do not have your service fully documented outside of the Bluemix doc app, you might choose to add topics (files) in addition to the getting started template. Organize your files under the respective nav groups in your toc file: **Learn**, **How To**, **Reference**, and **Help**. You define each of the nav groups based on the assigned ID, and you must use the assigned IDs. The doc app framework applies the appropriate nav group label at runtime. 

Organize your files under the respective nav groups: **Learn**, **How To**, **Reference**, and **Help**. You define each of the nav groups based on the assigned ID, and you must use the assigned IDs. The doc app framework applies the appropriate nav group label at runtime. 

Example `toc` source:

  ```
  {: .navgroup id="learn"}
  index.md
  account_type.md
  {: .navgroup-end}
    
  {: .navgroup id="howto"}
  {: .topicgroup}
  Pricing
      free.md
      billable.md
      how_charged.md
      estimating_costs.md
            
  changing_plan.md
    
  {: .topicgroup}
  Usage
      viewing_usage.md
      manage_usage.md
        
  linking_accounts.md
  accessing_infrastructure.md
  {: .navgroup-end}
    
  {: .navgroup id="help"}
  account_faq.md
  {: .navgroup-end}
  ```
  {: codeblock}

Example nav output:


  ```
Learn
  Account types

How to
  Pricing
    Creating free plans
    Creating billable plans
    Determining how charges are applied
    Estimating costs
  
  Changing your plan
  
  Usage
    Viewing your usage
    Managing your usage
    
Help
  Standard account FAQ

  ```

Use topic groups to group chunks of topics, if needed. You define the label displayed in the left nav for topic groups. Use gerunds for these labels. For example:

  ```
  {: .topicgroup}
  Tutorials
      tutorials/create_service.md
      tutorials/create_database.md
      tutorials/create_bmxapp.md
  ```
  {: codeblock}

Make sure the `&` symbol isn't included in links in your `toc` file. In most cases, you can shorten the path of links by deleting the `&` symbol and everything that comes after the symbol. 


### Excluding unwanted headings

You might not want every single heading in your markdown topic or topics to be rendered as part of your TOC. To exclude a heading, simply add the notoc attribute to the heading to exclude in your md file, as shown in the following example:

```
# Heading I want to exclude
{: #xreftext notoc}

## Another heading nested underneath
{: #api}
```

**Note**: In the previous example, the notoc attribute is only on the H1 heading. The notoc attribute cascades down and excludes any sub-headings nested beneath the heading you specify to exclude. You can add the notoc attribute to any heading at any depth; for example, H1, H2, H3, and so on.


# Markdown reference and advanced features

## Authoring Bluemix content in Markdown
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML.

The Markdown used for Bluemix is based on GitHub-flavored Markdown. The following resources can be helpful in coding the markup for you content:
* https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/
* https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/

Bluemix has designed a parser that transforms Markdown into HTML5. Because the syntax available in standard Markdown is limited, the Bluemix team has developed Extensions to provide an enhanced authoring experience. These extensions provide key features available in DITA today, adding, for example, the ability to use metadata attributes and content references in Markdown. This document provides instructions for using these extensions.

## Markdown editors
If you choose not to edit your content in the browser UI, there are many free Markdown editors available, however, not all editors will honor the syntax used by Bluemix extensions. You can use [Atom](https://atom.io) or [Orion](https://orionhub.org/).  Notepad ++ is compatible, and also supports YAML, which is used to define content reference keywords.

## Mappings between Markdown and HTML 5

|     Element     |   Markdown (Git flavored)  |   HTML 5      |
|-----------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| **container**    | No equivalent.      | `<article>`   |
| **title**       | `# ## ### ####`          | `<h1>...<h6> `|
|**short description**| Bluemix enabled, placed beneath the description:  `{:shortdesc}`, though the first thing under the title must be a paragraph of text. |`<p>`|
| **section** | `No equivalent` | `<section>` |
| **unordered list** | `*` or `-`<br/><br/>**Note**: Nested lists need to be indented four spaces or a tab, and mixing ordered and unordered lists does not work (use html)| `<ul><li></li></ul>` |

| **list item** | Use the appropriate list type; nested lists are supported: <br> `1. Item 1`<br>&nbsp;`1. A corollary to the above item.`<br>&nbsp;`2. Yet another point to consider.`<br>`2. Item 2`<br>&nbsp;`* A corollary that does not need to be ordered.`<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;` * This is indented four spaces, because it's two spaces further than the item above.`<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; `* You might want to consider making a new list.`<br>`3.

| **term** | No equivalent, use html coding. | `<dt>` |
| **definition** | No equivalent, use html coding. | `<dd>` |
| **paragraph** | No equivalent; paragraphs in Markdown are just one or more lines of consecutive text followed by one or more blank lines. | `<p>` |

Your cells do not need to line up on the page in Markdown when editing. <br>2. Tables in Markdown do not support explicit line breaks. To cheat, you can use the `<br>` HTML tag. | `<table>`<br>`<thead>`<br>`<tr>`<br>`<th>Header 1</th>`<br>`<th>Header 2</th>`<br>`</tr>`<br>`</thead>`<br>`<tbody>`<br>`<tr>`<br>`<td>`<br>`Content</td>`<br>`<td>Content</td>`<br>`</tr>`<br>`</tbody>`<br>`</table>` |

| **links** | You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in square brackets `( [ ] )`, and then wrapping the link in parenthesis `( ( ) )` immediately following the square brackets. <br><br> GFM will autolink standard URLs, so if you want to link to a URL (instead of setting link text), you can simply enter the URL and it will be turned into a link to that URL. <br><br>**Note**: to create an external link that opens in a new window, place the following attribute definition at the top of your file: `{:new_window: target="_blank"}` and then use the following attribute after your link `[link](url){: new_window}` | `<a href="https://www.link.com">Link Text</a>` |

## Bluemix extensions to Markdown
 The following Bluemix extensions to Markdown are supported:
 * Output all Markdown markup to standard, valid HTML5 tags
 * Additional attributes
 * Addition of headers and footers to the HTML output
 * Anchor IDs generated for all Headers
 * Output is fully accessible
 * Additional functionality

### Additional attributes
The Bluemix Markdown parser allows you to define additional attributes in Markdown. After your attributes are defined, you can apply these values to any markdown element, like headers, paragraphs, and codeblocks.

You can use the Bluemix attributes extension to map the following attributes to an element:
  * ID
  * Class
  * Custom value

**Note**: Attributes, when defined and applied within a Markdown file, are output by the Bluemix Markdown parser by default. No additional parameters or flags need to be passed to the parser when the command is run.

#### How attributes are defined in Markdown
Attributes are defined at the top of your Markdown file. Each Attribute definition must be enclosed in curly brackets { }, and must contain a unique name. You can provide attribute definition values for `ID`, `Class`, and `Custom`, but none of these values are required. You can define any combination of these different attribute values. The Bluemix attribute definition implementation is based on the Kramdown / Maraku Attribute Definition extension: (http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#attribute-list-definitions) as shown in the following example:

```
<!-- Attribute definition -->
{:Name: #ID .Class Custom='custom attribute'}
<!-- Sample Attribute definition -->
{:java: #java .ph data-hd-programlang='java'}

```

In this example, the following attributes are used:

* **:Name:** is the name of the attribute. This value does not get passed through to the output; it is an internal Markdown name that is used to map the attribute definition at the top of the page to one or more uses throughout the Markdown file. This value must be surrounded by colons (: :).
* **#ID** sets a value associated with the `ID` attribute. This value is optional. If I define an ID of `#java` in my attribute, and I set this attribute on a heading, the HTML5 output will produce `<h1 id="java"></h1>`. This value must begin with a pound sign (#).
* **.Class** sets a value associated with the `Class` attribute. This value is optional. If I define a Class of `.ph` in my attribute, and I set this attribute on a heading, the HTML5 output will produce `<h1 Class="ph"></h1>`. This value must begin with a pound period (.).
* **.Custom** sets a custom attribute value. This value is optional. If I define a `Custom` value of `data-hd-programlang='java'` in my attribute, and I set this attribute on a heading, the HTML5 output will produce `<h1 data-hd-programlang='java'></h1>`.

#### How attributes are applied in Markdown
After you define your attribute at the top of your Markdown file, you can apply the attribute by adding a call to the name of your attribute at the end of the Markdown tag you want to bind your attribute to. The implementation of Bluemix attribute usage is based on the Kramdown / Maraku Block/Span Inline Attribute Lists: http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#inline-attribute-lists

To apply a defined attribute, call the name of the attribute surrounded by curly brackets, and pre-pended by a colon and a space: `{: Name}`

For example:
I define a short description attribute at the top of my file and then apply it to a paragraph:
```
 {:shortdescription: .shortdesc}

 This is a short description paragraph
 {: shortdescription}

```
The Markdown parser will output HTML5 that looks like this:

```
<p class="shortdesc">This is a short description paragraph</p>

```

### Addition of headers and footers
Bluemix adds copyright and metadata to the header of the HTML 5 output. We have standard header and footer files that are called during transformation.

### Anchor IDs generated for all headings
When the Bluemix Markdown parser transforms Markdown to HTML5, it automatically binds an anchor ID to all Heading elements. Any time the parser transforms a Markdown file that contains a heading, the HTML5 output of that heading tag will produce an `id` attribute, with a value that is unique. Unique anchor IDs on heading provide writers with the ability to link directly to a sub-topic that begins with a Heading.

For example, here is a level 4 Heading in Markdown:
```
#### Content references in DITA vs Markdown
```
When the above Markdown is transformed into HTML5, the parser produces a unique id with a value that is equal to the name of the heading:
```
<h4 id="content-references-in-dita-vs-markdown">Content references in DITA vs Markdown</h4>
```
**Note**: Heading anchor IDs are output by the Bluemix Markdown parser by default. No additional parameters or flags need to be passed to the parser when the command is run.

#### Changing an anchor ID on a heading

The Anchor ID is bound to a heading by default, and it always uses the text of the heading as its name, so you can always just link to that. However, any time you want to override the anchor tag of a heading, you can use an attribute. See the Attribute section above for more details on using attributes.

Example of default anchor bound to a heading:

Mardown source:
`## Visualizing your data sample`

HTML5 output:
`<h2 id="visualizing-your-data-sample">Visualizing your data sample</h2>`

Example of remapping using a simple attribute (we use the ID attribute, which is mapped with the # character):

Markdown source:
```
## Visualizing your data sample
  {: #my-renamed-anchor}
```

HTML5 output:
`<h2 id="my-renamed-anchor">Visualizing your data sample</h2>`

**Note**: You could produce the same results by making an attribute definition at the top of your file, and then you would call the name of the attribute definition, like so:
```
{:myanchor: #my-renamed-anchor}

## Visualizing your data sample
  {: myanchor}
```

#### Linking to an anchor ID for a heading

You can link directly to a heading within a file using the heading anchor ID. You can link to sub-headings; it does not need to be the top-level heading. Use the automatically generated heading value based on the text that is defined in the heading, or add your own anchor ID to use for linking. The following example for linking uses user-defined ID anchors for each heading, and the goal is to provide a link to content that is further down in the same file.

```
Headings and user-defined heading anchors for my file:

# Bluemix
{: #bluemix}

My short description links to the [Applications heading](filename.html#heading_id).

## Services
{: #services}

## Applications
{: #applications}

I want to create a link within my short description that links to the second sub-heading, Applications.
To do this, I would use the following format: [Link text for heading](filename.html#heading_id).
For this example, I would use [Applications](readme.html#applications).
```

### Accessible output
We have worked to output all Markdown markup to standard and valid HTML5 tags:
* Alt text for images: Included as part of the Markdown tagging for images
* Header row in tables: Output turns the first row into `<thead>`
* Elements having a WAI-ARIA 'article' role must have a label specified with aria-label or aria-labelledby.
* Use header elements where appropriate: Pass thru HTML tagging when Markdown markup is not available, for example definition lists (dl, dt, dd)
* There must be a non-empty title element in the head of the document: For the HTML output from Markdown, the `<head>` element does not contain a `<title>` element. We added this with a header file.

Additional accessibility *might* be needed as content is migrated to Markdown. And, as a result, updates to the parser and/or to the markup recommendations *might* be required.

### Additional functionality
 * Copy of non-.md files: Copies (doesn't process) image files (.bmp, .jpg, .png, .gif, .SVG) and other file extensions like .html, .pdf, .json, .js
 * Recurse sub-directories: Processes all directories in the specified source directory
 * Overwrite: Addition of an overwrite flag to replace previous output

### Tips for avoiding common errors

1. Using HTML within your Markdown topics is allowed, and in some cases encouraged (the only way to output a definition list is by using HTML). However, if you chose to use HTML, **always ensure your HTML is well-formed**. Any tag that does not have a closing tag associated with it will break the parser, and your build will fail. For example, the only way that you can create a line break inside a table cell in Markdown is to use a break tag, however, using `<br>` will actually break the build. You must close the break tag like so: `<br/>`. If you use HTML, carefully validate that your tags are matching and that you close all open tags.
2. Avoid using `<` and `>`. For all special characters, it is recommended that you use the `&` value. For example, for `>` use `&gt;`.  All of the following special characters are also supported: (http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/HTMLPlus/htmlplus_13.html)
