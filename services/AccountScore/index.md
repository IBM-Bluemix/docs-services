# About AccountScore
{: #gettingstarted}

AccountScore is an analytics business based in London but with people in the USA and in India, which provides actionable insights and analytics on bank transaction data for our clients - typically banks and financial services companies who want to learn more about their customers, prospects and applicants.

Where our clients already have bank transaction data we simply import the data and provide analytics through our dashboards or by API. Accounts can be analysed individually, or we can process multiple accounts with millions of transaction rows in a single import.

Where our clients are non-banks that want to analyse bank data for their customers, or banks that want to analyse their customers’ transactions from other banks, we work with our sister company, consents.online, which obtains and stores transactions for clients and manages customers’ permissions for the viewing of this data. consents.online is a Registered Account Information Service Provider (AISP) with the Financial Conduct Authority, registration number 792642.

consents.online is a place where customers can control what consents they have given and to whom. Where consent has been granted, it connect to banks to collect the transaction data that our clients request. [Learn more about consents.online](https://consents.online){:new_window}

Clients of AccountScore can use consents.online on a back-to-back basis so do not need a direct contractual relationship with it.
