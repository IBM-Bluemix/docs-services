# About Actifio GO!
{: #gettingstarted}

Actifio GO on IBM Cloud is the next generation multi-cloud Copy Data Management SaaS solution that delivers a true SaaS experience: a complete self-service model where users can learn, evaluate, procure, expand and get support at the lowest cost in the industry. Actifio GO on IBM Cloud enables customers to backup Enterprise workloads (VMware, Hyper-V, Physical Servers, SAP HANA, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.)  directly to IBM Cloud while being able to instantly access the backup images within their data center. For VMware, Actifio GO leverages its patented OnVault technology to incrementally backup VMware data directly to IBM COS, eliminating local backup infrastructure while still maintaining instant access. Users can take advantage of IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) for long-term retention, as well as reuse backup copies to enable self-service database cloning for test/dev/qa/analytics teams.
