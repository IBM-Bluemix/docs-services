# Getting started with Apprenda Cloud Platform for Bluemix
{: #gettingstarted_Apprenda}

The Apprenda Cloud Platform (ACP) for Bluemix provides a comprehensive, policy driven, cloud application platform for development teams to develop, deploy, and scale cloud native and traditional application .NET workloads.  Visual Studio integration is available, including support for Bluemix services like Watson.

## First Time Setup
 If you are the first member of a Bluemix Space to access the platform, you will be prompted to create a new Development Team. Once subscribed, you will be forwarded to a registration page to complete the process.

 From there you will be presented with a list of tutorials, including deploying your own app, using the Visual Studio Extension, understanding how billing works, andusing IBM Watson services.
 
 You can access the platform portal directly at https://apps.bm.apprenda.com.
 
## Pricing
 Pricing is based on gigabytes per hour for RAM resources used by each running application workload you deploy.  RAM resources are determined by Resource Policies you allocate while configuring your application (Small, Medium, Large). Once allocated, the minimum billable time unit is 1 hour. Additional users can be added via the Apprenda Developer Portal at no additional cost. Users are added directly to the Apprenda Platform, IBM accounts are not required. Additional information can be found [here](https://apps.bm.apprenda.com/tutorial/how-bluemix-net-billing-works.html).
