## Getting started

Bitbar allows you to access hundreds of mobile devices in the cloud. Access is available using our web client or our well extensive API. 

Full API description is available through [here](https://cloud.bitbar.com/cloud/swagger-ui.html){:new_window} (requires you to be logged in).

Start account creation on the [Bitbar website](https://bitbar.com/signup/){:new_window}

After registration on website, you will receive an email with link to finish your activation process. Once the activation is done you are able to start running tests against the devices on Bitbar.

Login to your Bitbar and click your avatar icon in top right corner and go to 'My Account'. In the 'My Integrations' section click on 'API Access'. This shows your unique API_KEY you need to add to your IBM Cloud settings.

If your API_KEY ever gets compromised, you can generate a new one here. If you do so, remember to update your key everywhere you are using it, including in IBM Cloud settings.
