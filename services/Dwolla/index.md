# About Dwolla
{: #gettingstarted}

Dwolla now facilitates the movement of millions of dollars every day with low transaction costs, easy automation and near-perfect reliability. The goal is to make an incredibly complex process feel simple, easy and seamless to the people who use itâ€”our customers and their end users.

Applications should be built and tested in the Dwolla Sandbox environment before being used in production.

## Getting started

To begin your integration with the Dwolla API, you must first sign up for a Sandbox account. [Click here](https://developers.dwolla.com/){:new_window} to get started.

Once you've signed up for a Sandbox account, there are a few considerations before going live:

      1. Review our developer documentation, which includes quick start guides and resources to ease the integration process
      2. Work closely with a Business Development Representative to assist with creating a solution to fit your business' needs
      3. Completion of payment integration requirements, which includes items like Terms of Service updates, Privacy Policy updates, Information Security questionnaire, and customer email notifications

Once you have completed the previous steps, you are ready to launch your application.
