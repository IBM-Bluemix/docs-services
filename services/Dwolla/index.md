# About Dwolla
{: #gettingstarted}

Dwolla now facilitates the movement of millions of dollars every day with low transaction costs, easy automation and near-perfect reliability. The goal is to make an incredibly complex process feel simple, easy and seamless to the people who use itâ€”our customers and their end users.

Applications should be built and tested in the Dwolla Sandbox environment before being used in production.
