# About ElephantSQL
{: #gettingstarted}

ElephantSQL automates every part of setup and running of PostgreSQL clusters. Let your team focus on what they do best - building your product. Leave server management and monitoring to the experts.

## Getting started

ElephantSQL is a PostgreSQL database hosting service. ElephantSQL will manage administrative tasks of PostgreSQL, such as installation, upgrades to the latest stable version and backup handling.

To get started you need to sign up for a custom plan. What plan you want to use depend of your needs. We offer five different service plans, three dedicated clusters and two shared clusters.

Plan and pricing information can be found [here](https://www.elephantsql.com/plans.html){:new_window}.

The instance will be provisioned to you within a few minutes. The instance details, such as connection URL, can be seen at the details pages. 

From here will you also be able to restore backups and rotate your password. If you are on a dedicated plan (Happy Hippo or larger) you will be able to view server metrics, you can set up followers and you can view information for all your databases and use the database browser.

Connection URL format: postgres://username:password@hostname/databasename

Once you have created your account you can get started using your PostgreSQL database by using any of the guides listed [here](https://www.elephantsql.com/docs/index.html){:new_window}, depending on platform and language. These tutorials cover the basics of how to get started with ElephantSQL.

The database instance can be tested and used via different tools, e.g the ElephantSQL SQL browser, pgAdmin or psql. A link to ElephantSQL SQL browser page can be found from the management console for your instance. From that page, you can execute SQL queries from your web browser. 

psql is an interactive terminal for work with Postgres and pgAdmin is a graphical administration client for PostgreSQL.
