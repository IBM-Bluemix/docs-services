# About Enigma Confidential Computing Platform
{: #gettingstarted}

# Enigma Confidential Computing Platform
Enigma Confidential Computing Platform (ECCP) is an API which connects to a privacy-preserving storage and private computation service. ECCP allows organizations to share data in encrypted form, perform analysis to generate insights and to capture value without worrying about data liability or data privacy concerns.

The ECCP system consists of two core components. 
1. A client-side UI responsible for encrypting user data and submitting encrypted data via the API, as well as receiving encrypted outputs and decrypting and displaying them appropriately. 
2. ECCP, which is responsible for data storage and compute services.

This repository is for SafeTrace, an implementation of ECCP for privacy preserving contract tracing. Users should think of SafeTrace as a reference implementation that demonstrates use of the ECCP. 


SafeTrace allows users to privately share (encrypted) location history and test status, to get notifications if they have been in close proximity with diagnosed individuals and to monitor higher risk locations in real-time. 

This repository is aimed to be a sample implementation of ECCP for contact tracing in the fight against Covid19. The same architecture can be used for a variety of use-cases that involve fraud in online platforms and marketplaces, machine learning for training data sets, consolidating data set and numerous other use cases. In order to use this architecture for any other user case, see:
1. The SafeTrace [API](https://github.com/enigmampc/SafeTrace/api-server/) to see how clients interact with the server. This focuses on local data encryption and communication of encrypted data to the server
2. The [Client](https://github.com/enigmampc/SafeTrace/client/) folder for a sample integration for SafeTrace
3. This [rust code](https://github.com/enigmampc/SafeTrace/blob/7094bf340e53743950903a2febd8f3c780490296/enclave/safetrace/enclave/src/data.rs#L228) is the algorithm which performs individual location matching for SafeTrace. A user could modify or substitute this with another algorithm for a desired use-case.

## Overview & Motivation for SafeTrace
Contact-tracing is the use of information about where an individual has been, and who they may have come into contact with, as a way to track and manage the spread of viruses. Smartphone data provides a ready source of highly detailed information that can be used to automate contact-tracing.
Automated contact-tracing applications face two problems:
- *Data Privacy*: Contact-tracing relies on accurate and granular data about the userâ€™s location and/or proximity to other users. This data is used in conjunction with a user's infection status to determine their risk level. Collecting this type of information about users places a significant data security burden on whatever organization is gathering the data or has access to it. Methods which are privacy preserving largely sacrifice data utility.
- *Data Utility*: Existing privacy-preserving contact-tracing methods (bluetooth) only inform individuals of their risk, and are of limited use to health officials, researchers, or crisis response, who need aggregate data for research and heat maps.

SafeTrace is an API which connects to a privacy-preserving storage and private computation service. 
This means that applications (web or mobile) can enable users to submit encrypted location and health status data for analysis via the SafeTrace API, without ever revealing plaintext data to anyone, including the SafeTrace server operator or the application. This relies on Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), a technology for preserving data privacy while data is in-use. Then, SafeTrace analysis can produce two types of reports-- individual and global-- based on the aggregate data submitted by all applications. SafeTrace can be used to overcome both privacy concerns and data utility problems for contact-tracing.

# System Architecture
This system architecture relies on two core elements:


## 1. A Privacy-preserving Computation service

Private computation is a term for performing tasks on data that is never viewed in plaintext. Our system will use private computation to generate individual and global analytics. In this scenario, private computation techniques could be employed to:
1. Identify users who have been in close proximity with individuals who have tested positive for 
2. Create heatmaps from diagnosed patients' location data, using clustering algorithms to prevent revealing of data to anyone, and output those results to a map
3. Apply differential privacy techniques to diagnosed patient data to be used for research purposes

We use an Intel-SGX based service that uses [Trusted Execution Environments ](https://software.intel.com/en-us/sgx/details) (TEE). Additional alternative private compute techniques that could be incorporated to this approach include homomorphic encryption, multiparty computation, and differential privacy. The ECCP solution proves what code is being executed over the data, proves enclave integrity via Intel Attestation Service (IAS), and contains Rust code for the matching and heatmap algorithms. This service maintains a database of user data submissions, which is encrypted when not in use for a computation. 

Input:
- Encrypted user location histories in Google Takeout JSON format
- Encrypted (self-reported) testing status

Output:
- Positive matches between users who have had positive test results and users who overlapped with them on time and proximity for individual reporting
- Clustering algorithm to run on location history of users who have had positive test results (with time dependent weights) for global view

***Note: Privacy preserving analysis listed above can be extended to any kind of analysis including machine learning for other use-cases that leverage Enigma Confidential Computing Platform***


## 2. A Client-side UI
The client-side UI is responsible for gathering user data, encrypting that data, and for displaying and receiving encrypted outputs.
This component contains the self-reporting UI, displays the individual proximity match report from post-compute results, and displays a heat map view of positively tested participants (global results) from post-compute results. The goals of this component are to:
1. Clearly communicates to users the goals and possible risks of the service
2. Walk users through obtaining and sanitizing Google Takeout location data
3. Provide https-like assurances that UI is in communication with successfully attested enclave
4. Enable users to create a persistent email/password log-in
5. Enables users to submit, and update:
    - 1-2 months of location history in Google Takeout JSON format
    - Current infection status (positive, negative, untested)
    - Date test was administered
6. Runs data formatting and simple data validation on the browser

The aims of the graphical user interface (GUI) are to after receiving output data are to:
- Inform individuals who have been in close proximity of diagnosed patients (time and location) via a notification system.
- Create heatmaps for users (individual and social organizations) to track the current status virus outbreak at a granular level.

## Getting started

This folder contains sample Javascript code to interface with the enclave via a JSON RPC Server. At the time of this writing
there is a live instance of the enclave + JSON RPC Server that you can interact with at https://safetrace.enigma.co.

If you visit https://safetrace.enigma.co with your browser, you'll get a `405 Error: Method not allowed` because it does not
accept GET requests like the ones that regular browsers make. Instead, you have to POST properly formatted JSON-RPC requests:

The client code in this folder is meant to be used as a reference and adapted for your own client. It has not been packaged
as a library yet, but you should be able to copy/paste the relevant functions into your code. 


You can run: 
```bash
node index.js
```

to see an example of working code that submits data for two users into the enclave, and later queries for a match between the
two datasets, returning one match.

Below are included example requests and responses for each endpoint using [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) from the command line.

*NOTE: The parameters `encryptedUserId` and `encryptedData` are encrypted with an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key, so you need
to run the method `newTaskEncryptionKey` everytime to be able to derive that key, and use it to encrypt these parameters. Each key can only be used once, so running any command like this through `curl` reusing parameters from a previous operation like the ones presented here, results in a failed operation.*

```

*NOTE: Analogously to the previous method, the input and output from this method are encrypted, which you can encrypt and
decrypt with the key derived through Diffie-Hellman. Again, the command and output included here are for reference 
purposes, but you will not be able to reproduce verbatim. Instead, you have to run `newTaskEncryptionKey` and use that
for encryption and decryption. Each key can only be used once, so running any command like this through `curl` reusing parameters from a previous operation like the ones presented here, results in a failed operation.*
