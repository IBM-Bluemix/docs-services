## Pricing Plans and Billing
 
HPCaaS from Rescale provides a “Standard” plan. This plan follows a consumption-based pricing model for all utilized resources, including compute, desktop, application software packages, storage and data transfer and license servers for application software packages. You will not be charged until you start using the service instance you've defined to  execute your HPC workloads. Once your HPC job completes, the Rescale platform will record the consumed resources and the associated costs will be calculated and displayed on the **Rescale -> Account -> Charges** usage page.
 
At the end of the month all the usage charges will be processed by IBM Cloud for billing. The total charges associated for each of the resources listed above will be displayed on IBM Cloud usage dashboard by the 3rd business day of the month following the month to which the charges apply. IBM cloud will generate a monthly invoice that will include all charges for the HPCaaS from Rescale service instances.
