# About Powerlytics Behavior/Propensity Model API
{: #gettingstarted}

The Powerlytics Behavior/Propensity Model Development API can be leveraged to develop new or improve upon existing customer behavior/propensity models, such as customer retention models, consumer default models, marketing response models, etc.  When leveraging the Powerlytics data within these types of models, our customers have an improvement in prediction power of up to 50% (50% increase in KS Score).  Our Behavior/Propensity Model Variables can be imported into your data science environment in order to run a variety of model selection and logit regression techniques to identify the combination of internal and Powerlytics variables that most significantly increase predictive power.
