# About Simplicite aPaaS low-code
{: #gettingstarted}

The Simplicité® platform offers you a wide range of generic mechanisms to dynamically run your business models. The configuration is data centric meaning that any business application configuration starts with the configuration of a logical data model. Then, on top of this data model, custom behaviors can be added:

* Rights enforcements
* Contextual constraints
* State model workflows
* Activity workflows
* and more...

## Getting started

The Simplicité® platform is composed of several components (see [this document for details](https://www.simplicite.io/resources/documentation/architecture.md) on the platform’s technical architecture).

Based on what is processed by the engine, the platform offers various presentation/publication layers.
