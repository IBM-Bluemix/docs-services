# About 
{: #gettingstarted}

Skytap cloud is purpose-built to enable you to natively run your traditional applications in the cloud. Skytap is the only cloud that supports virtual machines running AIX, IBM i, and Linux on IBM Power, as well as x86 workloads.

Your environments can be as simple as a single virtual machine or as complex as an entire virtual data center with dozens of virtual machines, multiple networks, and applications. Skytap can be used for multiple purposes, including development, testing, modernization, demos, and production.
