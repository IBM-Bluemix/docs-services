## Getting started

Skytap is a cloud service for creating, managing, and sharing virtual machine environments.

Each environment consists of one or more virtual machines and one or more networks. Environments can be as simple as a single VM, or as complex as an entire virtual data center, with dozens of VMs, multiple networks, and applications.

These environments can be used for pretty much anything (development, testing, demos, production) and accessed from pretty much anywhere
