## Devices

Bitbar Testing Cloud provides the largest device farm of real mobile devices, gathered from different regions globally, including the most versatile OS, OEM and hardware configurations for Android and iOS developers. Bitbar Testing Cloud provides a test automation, [remote manual device access](http://bitbar.com/remote-manual-access-to-any-android-device-at-testdroid-cloud/) and REST API to access, run and manage any tests with these devices.

Bitbar Testing Cloud is a mobile app, game and web testing service that enables developers to run their tests on real, physical Android and iOS devices that are all hosted on our secure premises. These devices are hosted in three different locations - Wroclaw, Poland, Mountain View, CA and Oulu, Finland - and are monitored and maintained 24 hours per business day. Our up-time is over 99% and sophisticated monitoring system keeps our devices running at the same rate.

The devices, infrastructure, test runs and assets will be maintained and all data resides on our premises.

The test reports contain detailed information about the execution of app on these devices, with access to logs, pixel-accurate screenshots, performance statistics/data, as well as high-level result overview of success/failure of the test runs. All this data will be available when test run on each device in completed. The data is downloadable and considered as your own asset.

Bitbar Testing Cloud allows users to upload their own tests or use built-in, script-free compatibility tests and crawlers. Devices can be used in parallel with test automation frameworks. For remote manual access only one device can be used at time.

Bitbar Testing Cloud provides support for native, hybrid and web apps on Android and iOS devices and browsers. Any applications created on PhoneGap, Titanium, Unity3D or some other framework are fully supported at Bitbar Testing Cloud devices.

## Test automation

Developing mobile applications is very different from developing PC software or even embedded software. Mobile development is meant to be agile, and a lot of great tools and practices have been developed for that agility. However, doing something manually — such as testing an app — is never agile, which is why test automation has shown tremendous growth among app and game developers, speeding up their doings and yielding robust and better results.

All Bitbar products have been built for test automation. The remote manual access to devices on our data centers complements this offering and occasionally developers want to make sure their apps work just like they've planned - and this is where our Manual Testing is extremely useful.

Test Automation relies real mobile devices (Android, iOS) and offers the possibility to test mobile apps and websites instantly and effectively using test automation frameworks. Our infrastructure is build to support unlimited number of simultaneous test runs, meaning that you can select any number of devices for your test run.

The true benefit of test automation comes from these simultanous test runs, automated access, coverage, and runs on devices, repeatability nature of tests, and identical and accurate tests - that could probably never get to accurate with manual testing.

* **Open Standards** - Our test automation relies only on open
     standards that are widely used in the industry. Open standards
     mean there are no vendor lock-ins, source code is always open and
     available, and developers can incrementally develop new tests and
     focus on compelling features with their apps.

* **Automation without Complexity** - Automated testing can increase
     the depth and scope of tests and significantly improve software
     quality. Lengthy and thorough tests — often not doable with
     manual testing — can be run automatically. Automated tests can
     easily execute thousands of complex test cases during every test
     run, providing coverage that is simply not possible with manual
     testing.

* **Cost Efficient and Effective** - Depending on the size of the
     project and the application, test automation will always provide
     a good return on investment. Once tests have been created,
     automated tests can be run over and over again at no additional
     cost. Test automation typically reduces the time required to run
     repetitive tests from weeks to hours. This is a significant
     time-saving that translates directly into cost-saving.

* **Integration with Agile Process and Tools** - To get the most out
     of your efforts and maximize testing coverage, select the most
     robust and most cross-platform method - and hook it up with your
     continuous integration, development and deployment system. Once
     you build an app, the system can automatically push it for
     testing on devices on cloud. This saves a lot of time, produces
     instant results and developers can fix any issues instantly.

In order to automate your mobile testing, you can use different types of procedures and methods to accomplish the real device coverage, compatibility and full functional testing. For example, there are three ways to produce tests for any mobile application:

* **Handwritten Tests** - Typically, this is the best choice when you
     know what you’re doing and when you have programming-capable
     people doing the test scripts. Plenty of options are available
     for test automation frameworks, tools and integration — both
     commercial and open-source offerings. Having your engineers write
     all of the test scripts will take up some time and tie up
     resources, but it will get you exactly what you want:
     well-structured, thorough scripts that test precisely the aspects
     of your app that you want to test.

* **Record and Playback Approach** - This approach is less
     error-prone because nothing needs to be written in code, but it
     is typically more limited in functionality. Tests can be quickly
     recorded and then played back again and again against different
     OS versions and device configurations. These tests focus on user
     interactions and user-driven activities. Some things might fall
     beyond a test’s scope (such as integration with other
     technologies and compatibility with other software).

* **Automatic Test Exercisers** - Automatic test exercisers provide a
     great way to smoke-test applications. No specific tests are
     needed; rather, the focus is on testing user-interface logic
     (such as opening menus, clicking buttons, swiping and
     multi-gesture actions). Automatic test exercisers yield the least
     exact results but provide quick feedback on each iteration of an
     app.

In order to evaluate what test automation framework works you the best please take a look our comparison of each and if needed please consult us to find you and your app the most suitable test automation framework.
