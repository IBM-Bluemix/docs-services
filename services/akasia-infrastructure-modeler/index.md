## Getting started

Getting started on Akasia Infrastructure Modeler is easy.  Once your on-premises VMware information is gathered by our lightweight and non-intrusive collector, you can perform scenario analysis on how your workloads should be "packed" and configured on IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions and optimize for compute, memory, network and storage configurations to give you the best price for performance.

Download the collector and install in your on-premises environment.  The collector interfaces with vCenter and enumerates and discovers all your VMs and associated infrastructure as as well as your applications non-invasively.

What-if analysis can be accomplished easily.  You can group VMs together by function, and perform scenario analysis on how best to "pack" your VMs into the resultant hosts on IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions.  In doing so your target environment hosted on IBM Cloud can be optimized for costs while improving performance.
