# About 
{: #gettingstarted}

The aim of this document is to describe the Simple Animation platform from a technical and user point of view. The focus on guiding the user through the different, necessary processes has been maintained throughout, although without omitting the essential explanations relating to technical aspects. 

This document does not necessarily follow the logical common thread suggested by the functional areas of Simple Animation Client. Most functional áreas are described in separate sections for clarity.


{:shortdesc}

## Getting started

You can access Simple Animation via the URL: [https://studio.simpleanimation.com/](https://studio.simpleanimation.com/){:new_window}

To register a user in Simple, you must provide an email address and a username. The system will then send you an email with a link for you to verify your email address. 
Once you click on the link provided in your email, Simple Animation will verify your email address and you will be logged in. 
If, for any reason, you do not receive the verification email, contact us through the contact tab which is shown in the section 0 ports which should be open in the firewall in order to access Simple Animation. 


443 (TCP): access to the internet and to the Simple Animation desktop application
14172 y 24172 (TCP y UDP): connection to Remote Desktop with protocol PCoIP
11443 y 22443 (TCP y UDP): connection to Remote Desktop with protocol Blast Extreme
18443 y 28443 (TCP y UDP): connection to Remote Desktop with protocol RDP, USB and multimedia redirection (MMR)
21, 40001-40200 (TCP): used for FTPS connections (file transfer) 


Contact 

In order to continue with the registration, you must fill in the contact details and select “site” studio associated with the user profile. The chosen “site” determines the location of the remote machine to which the user will connect. You must select the nearest site to your physical location (that of lowest latency).

The chosen site can later be changed in the “profile” section. This is useful in the event that the user wishes to connect from a different physical location (for example, while travelling, change of residence, etc.)

In order to create a new studio, the following data must be specified: 

●	Studio name/ studio code: this is the name of the studio. The system will also generate a studio code which will be used to identify the internal structure. This studio code cannot be changed once it has been created and accepted. 

●	Main site: select where you wish to set the main site for your studio from among different sites. The main site will determine where the data from the different projects will be stored, therefore for a more efficient rendering, it is recommended that you choose the site nearest to the majority of the studio users. 



![Documentation image](https://mp.s81c.com/pwb-production/365bcb02ef159a56df2c34b6c16acc4c/Imagen14-5962b7ce-4965-46d8-84bf-d87aaf327d18_c7eb46b9-94f8-4569-a1ee-9d36f0cb269f.png)

Simple Animation creates studios in the different sites which it has available so that you can access your information at any time, from anywhere in the world. However, if you wish for your hired workstations to access the different sites, you must contract a multisite plan

Invoicing information
Every studio must have an invoice information form associated with it in order to create a studio and access all the functions of Simple Animation. 
The same invoicing information may be used for as many studios as you wish, however, you cannot provide two or more invoice information forms for the same studio. 


![Documentation image](https://mp.s81c.com/pwb-production/365bcb02ef159a56df2c34b6c16acc4c/Imagen15-3509c6c2-85f5-4a5f-93af-53232c8b0c8f_ead1737e-7d61-4b7b-841e-2a965bd09bfa.png)

If you wish, you may skip this step and later you will be able to include other invoice forms based on who makes the payment and set a list of favourites. 

Note*: 

In order to complete the invoice information form, you must provide the following data:
●	Legal name 
●	Tax ID number 
●	Currency (EUR/USD/GBP)

Invite teammates
In the invitations tab, you will be able to search for users within Simple Animation to invite them to collaborate in your studio or invite a new, unregistered user via email. 

The person who is invited, whether or not they have previously registered with Simple Animation, must accept the invitation they receive via email before they are able to collaborate in a studio.


![Documentation image](https://mp.s81c.com/pwb-production/365bcb02ef159a56df2c34b6c16acc4c/Imagen17-4e9fc2e3-e951-4a64-930c-ccdfee7f6d2a_1be6f1d3-538e-4528-b657-a55c8397d535.png)

The user will receive an email with an invitation link in their email account. Once the link has been accepted, they will be redirected to the Simple Animation webpage in order to confirm the registration. Once registered, the user will appear as a new member in your studio. 
To send the invitation, you must complete the following fields: 
●	Email 
●	Message 



![Documentation image](https://mp.s81c.com/pwb-production/365bcb02ef159a56df2c34b6c16acc4c/Imagen18-0846af5f-2513-4882-9ab9-dda0fef2b359_0965e8ab-2780-4bfa-9aaf-39a37d6ede26.png)



In the “Team” section, you will be able to see the list of users associated with your studio or invite new members. You will also be able to set permissions to different members of your studio. 
In the “Team members” tab, only those users who have accepted the invitation to participate in your studio will appear.

Rol and permissions
Granting permissions to different users of a studio. 
In a studio, there can be different levels of access based on the load within the studio


![Documentation image](https://mp.s81c.com/pwb-production/365bcb02ef159a56df2c34b6c16acc4c/Imagen20-b04254b0-8b50-4f42-8fc3-90afbeff7b00_1157860f-47b9-4baf-a107-549c5995b395.png)

●	Studio manager: permission is granted to one or several to manage the studio. This profile can also grant permissions to other users. 

●	Internet access: this determines whether internet access is granted from the workstations. 

●	Global FTP: this determines whether the user or users can access the studio information via FTP. It is possible to grant upload permissions and/or the downloading of files. These permissions depend on the level of security which you wish to grant the users of your studio.

Access to FTP

If you wish to access the storage using the file transfer protocol (FTP), it is possible with Simple Animation. 

You must take into account that, based on the storage which you wish to access, the local prefix must be added.
 
Server: 

• Frankfurt: fraftp.simpleanimation.com  
• Dallas: dalftp.simpleanimation.com
• Tokyo: tyoftp.simpleanimation.com
 
Port: 21

Encryption: Require explicit FTP over TLS
 
Simple Animation username and password  


![Documentation image](https://mp.s81c.com/pwb-production/365bcb02ef159a56df2c34b6c16acc4c/Imagen22-61bcb263-0f93-4d08-92bb-1314b512434f_4cac1f6d-f341-45aa-bf9a-f1308b7a8daa.png)




The workstations are virtual remote machines, accessible from any PC (Windows/Mac Os/Linux). 
The virtual machines can be fixed in the different geographical locations offered by Simple Animation. Based on the site to which you connect, this will help to diminish the latency between your local device and the virtual machines. 
You can also configure every virtual machine with different characteristics both in software and in hardware based on your needs. 
Within the hardware characteristics, you can choose between seven available profiles (X50/X100/X200/X400/X800/X1600/X3200). 
Within the software characteristics, the installation is performed by simply dragging the software icon that you wish within the workstation profile. You can save as many profiles as you wish, with the configuration which adapts more to the different studio profiles or users, with no additional cost. 

Mínimum requirements

To connectto the virtual machine (VDI) here you can find the mínimum requirements to run VMware horizon client

[https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Horizon-Client-for-Windows/5.0/horizon-client-windows-installation/GUID-D223AA9A-F2FF-439E-AD82-3C469AC0F1ED.html](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Horizon-Client-for-Windows/5.0/horizon-client-windows-installation/GUID-D223AA9A-F2FF-439E-AD82-3C469AC0F1ED.html){:new_window}

21, 40001-40200 (TCP): used for FTPS connections (file transfer). 

Workstation profiles

The workstation profiles are designed so that you have different configurations (both hardware and software) based on the studio needs. Once created, the profiles will be saved within the studio and, in order to assign them, it is as simple as dragging the workstation to a user or users. 

Creating a new workstation profile

This option allows new workstation profiles to be created. 
You must select a name and an identification code. 
What type of workstation resources you set (X50/X100/X200/X400/X800/X1600/X3200) 
Set the options and workstation security. 
Selection the software that you want to use in your workstation. 
Remember that once configured, you must update your workstation profile in order to save the changes carried out. 



![Documentation image](https://mp.s81c.com/pwb-production/365bcb02ef159a56df2c34b6c16acc4c/Imagen23-9d4c7ae4-0c6c-43de-9336-e67f639a0a0f_fdcd8646-542e-4b90-91ef-8a1dcc0fb5f9.png)




The Simple Animation storage consists of setting the virtual volumes on the cloud. Said volumes can be created with static size or with dynamic growth. 

In the “storage” menu, you can consult the relevant information relating to the studio storage. 

Simple Animation allows you to create a common storage space for all of your studio projects or create independent storages. These preferences are set in the menu Studio-> project-> project storage. 

Simple Animation allows you to create as many storage volumes as you wish, each with a minimum of 100GB of space. 

The volume named “software reserved storage” is destined to save studio elements which are not accessible to the user (software settings, information about virtual machines, pipeline, etc.) 

Create storage

Create a new storage, for this it is necessary to set the following options: 

●	Disk name / code name: the name can be whatever you like; but remember that this generates a reference name which will not be modifiable once set. 
●	Capacity: select the storage capacity (this is set according to your purchase plan) 100GB- 10TB. 
●	Allow automated 250GB storage: select a setting which will automatically expand the storage in units of 250GB when it reaches 90% of its full capacity. 

You must take into account that the maximum storage capacity in one volume from the application is 10TB. If you wish to increase your storage capacity to more than 10TB, contact Simple Animation support.

Information about my storage

In this section we show the information about the created storage volumes. It is also possible to modify, disable or delete any storage volume. 

The storage volumes have the following characteristics: 

●	Storage name/ code name: name and storage code. 
●	My storage capacity: size of storage volume. 
●	Space usage: the amount used of the total capacity. 
●	Linked projects: projects to which the storage is associated. 

Remember that once the storage data has been modified, it is necessary to update to save the information.

In this section, you will be able to manage the licenses with which you wish to use your software. 
The accepted system of licenses at Simple Animation are network licenses. 
A network licence allows various users of the same TCP/IP network to share the access to the product licenses. Control the distribution of the licenses to the users. When starting a product, a licence is requested in the licenses server through the network. If there is an available licence, it will be assigned to the workstation and the number of available licenses on the server will be reduced by one. When leaving a product, the licence returns. Once logged out of the final session, the licence will be available. 

You have two options 
●	Buy new licenses 
●	Add licenses 

Buy new licenses

Simple Animation is the official distributor of Autodesk, you can request an estimate with as many licenses and software as you wish. 
To make a purchase of licenses, it is necessary to select in the section “available licenses to purchase” the software that you need, (pay close attention to the version of software that you buy). 
Drag it to the licenses to buy section, choose the number of licenses you require and accept the purchase



![Documentation image](https://mp.s81c.com/pwb-production/365bcb02ef159a56df2c34b6c16acc4c/Imagen30-7c6f1288-0a5a-403f-93a5-cf8b1dbb2558_4da2f356-08dc-442e-ab5d-08407c108018.png)

Add licenses

If you have network licenses for your own studio and you do not wish to purchase new licenses, you can include your license server within your studio in Simple Animation. 
This allows you to share the same licence server between your physical studio and your studios in Simple Animation. 

To upload licenses, you can do this in two ways: 
●	Via the Mac address of the licenses server. 
●	Loading the licenses folder from your own computer. 



From the processing section, you can create your own render farm.

In order to do this, you must have to render nodes available which can be obtained through the purchase plans.

In order to set your render farm, you must have the following information:

●	Render farm name: decide how you want to call your own render farm. 
●	Code farm name: choose a code to identify the name of your render farm. 
●	Available nodes: you must have a render node assigned to your payment plan. 

Render farm configuration: 

●	Farm agent: this is an administration tool for rendering farms on Windows, Linux and Mac OSX. It allows its users the freedom to access easily any combination of local and cloud resources for your rendering and processing needs. 
In order to add this to your farm, select the farm agent which best suits your needs from the “Farm Manager” tab. 

●	Nodes: the nodes are servers. Within your payment plan, you will be able to choose from different CPU, GPU and RAM configurations based on your rendering and processing needs. 
In order to add nodes to your render farm, select your available nodes and drag them to the tab “Farm Nodes”. 

●	Available software: indicate which software you wish to be included within the rendering nodes. 
You must analyse your project’s production process and decide which software you need in order to render.

Select studio

Connecting to the workstation section.
Select the studio where you wish to begin or continue working. A list of workstations will appear where you will have permissions to connect. If no set workstation appears, contact the owner or the project manager of the studio you belong to, and they will assign one of the created profiles to their user. Once the information has been updated, the workstation should appear in this same section. 

Select a workstation profile

Once the workstation has been selected and set to a user, you will be able to see the technical characteristics in the drop down menu. 

You can consult the technical characteristics of your workstation.
Set the nearest site to which you wish to connect (this can only temporarily be changed from the user profile section). 
Type of protocol to which you wish to connect, depending on your user needs:

●	PCoIP: this protocol allows maximum quality and 3D functionality with the best audio quality. This is the protocol which has the most bandwidth requirements. The Wacom tablet system and other similar ones (HIV) are not fully supported by this protocol. 
●	Blast Extreme: this allows good quality and 3D functionality, using a lower bandwidth than the PCoIP protocol. The Wacom tablet system and other similar ones (HIV) are not fully supported by this protocol. 
●	RDP (HID support): this is the best protocol in terms of quality, bandwidth and fully supports the Wacom tablet systems and other similar systems (HID) 

To connect, all you have to do is click “connect” or click on the icon
